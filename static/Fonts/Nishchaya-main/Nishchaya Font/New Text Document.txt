This is my first attempt to create a font. I am not responsible for any damages occuring in any way arising out of using this font.

This release contains a lighter (thin) version of the font. On receiving the feedback, i have plans to release other version of the fonts. Note the below points before using and giving feedback:

1) These fonts does not have `talekattu'
2) The ಅರ್ಕಾವತ್ತು is omitted by design. ಸರ್ಕಾರ will be rendered as ಸರ್‍ಕಾರ.
3) The ಶಿ is designed differently.
4) The font "Nishchaya Hosabaraha" is designed to omit ಹೆದ್ದುಲಿ (ಮಹಾಪ್ರಾಣ).  It will undergo further refinement with the feedback to simplify the language.
5) Latin (English) characters are not yet included and will be added at a later stage.
6) The fonts are free for commercial or personal use.
