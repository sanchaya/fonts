# Padyakke Libre

### About Padyakke ###

Padyakke is a wide, airy, and friendly font for the Kannada writing system. Its gracefully balanced thin strokes rise up over sumptuously swollen bottoms. Padyakke was designed to pair with Aoife Mooney’s latin typeface BioRhyme; thus BioRhyme’s idosyncratic bowls, not-quite-perpendicular stroke terminals, and teardrop terminals are also in Padyakke.

Padyakke’s Kannada glyphs were designed by James Puckett. Padyakke’s Latin glyphs were designed by Aoife Mooney.

Official source files and compiled fonts are released at: https://github.com/DunwichType/Padyakke_Libre

Source files for Kannada PDF proofs are in the Dunwich Type proofs repository: https://github.com/DunwichType/DTF_Proofs

### Important Technical Information ###

** Use Glyphs 2.3b! **

As of version 1.401 Padyakke is built with Glyphs 2.3. Padyakke is not compatible with older versions of Glyphs. If you open the file in older versions of Glyphs many component positions and sidebearings *will* break.

Padyakke 1.401 fonts were compiled with Glyphs 2.3b (885). Attempting to compile with some earlier versions of 2.3b *will* result in broken fonts.

Padyakke contains manual hinting data but it is not used in compiled fonts due to bugs in Glyphs. The provided TTF font is not hinted. It was configured as per Dave Crossland’s instructions at: https://github.com/googlefonts/gf-docs/blob/master/HowToGenerateWebNativeFontsWithFontForge.md
