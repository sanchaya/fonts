Hubballi ಹುಬ್ಬಳ್ಳಿ
==============

Hubballi is a Kannada and Latin typeface designed by [Erin McLaughlin](http://www.erinmclaughlin.com). Hubballi is a monolinear typeface with an informal, friendly appearance. It was created by drawing a skeleton form in RoboFont that was then expanded via the "[Outliner](https://github.com/typemytype/RoboFontExtensions/tree/master/outliner)" extension by Frederik Berlaen. It is my intention to expand the design to additional weights, due to the relative ease of the skeleton/Outliner workflow.

Hubballi will be available for free via the Google Fonts.

Feel free to contact me using the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/erinmclaughlin/Hubballi/issues/) with comments or questions.
